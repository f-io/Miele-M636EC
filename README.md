The layout let you choose between the old plastic film or tactile switches. <br>
I've choosen the old plastic film, if it failes in the future you can just solder in switches.

You just need to substitute the old flexcabel with regular wires. <br>
Pinheader (pin spacing) on the keypad is the same as on the MCU board.

## Error codes

E2 = NTC temperature sensor <br>
E5 = Temperature (hot air), only applys to convection oven models <br>
E6 = Temperature microwave <br>
E14 = Air flap does not open in microwave mode <br>
E15 or E = Temperature error - deleteable "C" <br>


## Motivation

Miele did not want to supply the required spare parts, they just offered a new microwave oven. <br>
The original keypad is known to fail, maybe you can repair your microwave as well to help reduce electronic waste!<br>
